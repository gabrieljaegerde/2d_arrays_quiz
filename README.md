## Java 2D Array Operations Assignment

Welcome to the Java 2D Array Operations Assignment! This assignment is designed to enhance your understanding and skills in manipulating two-dimensional arrays in Java. You will engage in tasks such as initializing 2D arrays, finding maximum values, calculating averages, and flattening arrays. Follow the TODO comments in the code for guidance on each exercise.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example` directory where you will find the `TwoDArrayOperations.java` class file.
3. Open the `TwoDArrayOperations.java` file and complete the exercises as per the instructions in the TODO comments.
4. Once you've completed the exercises, run the provided tests to verify your solutions.

### Exercises to Complete

In the `TwoDArrayOperations.java` file, the following exercises are available:

1. **Initialize and Print a 2D Array**
   - Initialize a 2D array of integers and print its contents in a matrix format.

2. **Find the Maximum Value in a 2D Array**
   - Implement the logic to find the maximum value within a 2D integer array.

3. **Check for a Specific Value in a 2D Array**
   - Implement the logic to check if a specific integer value is present in the 2D array.

4. **Calculate the Average of All Elements in a 2D Array**
   - Implement the logic to calculate the average value of all elements in a 2D integer array.

5. **Sum of Diagonal Elements in a 2D Array**
   - Calculate and return the sum of diagonal elements in the 2D array.

6. **Flatten a 2D Array into a 1D Array**
   - Implement the logic to convert the 2D array into a flat 1D array.

### Running Tests

After completing the exercises, check your solutions by running tests located in the `src/test/java/com/example` directory.

To run the tests, use the command:

```
./gradlew test
```

### Submission

After ensuring all your solutions are correct and all tests pass, push your code to your GitHub repository.

This assignment is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of 2D arrays in Java, which are vital in many programming scenarios. Use this opportunity to enhance your array manipulation skills.

Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!
